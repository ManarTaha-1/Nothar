                            Wind turbines use blades to capture the kinetic energy of moving air. As the blades turn, they spin a generator that produces electricity. These turbines can be installed on land (onshore) or at sea (offshore), with offshore installations typically benefiting from stronger and more consistent winds.
                            
                            <br> Onshore vs. Offshore Wind Farms
                            Onshore wind farms are more common and easier to install, especially in open landscapes like plains and mountain passes. However, offshore wind farms—located in oceans or large lakes—can generate more energy due to powerful and uninterrupted wind flow. Europe, especially the UK and the Netherlands, has invested heavily in offshore wind infrastructure.
                            
                            <br> Integration with National Grids
                            As wind power expands, national electricity grids are adapting. Smart grid technology helps manage the variability of wind energy, ensuring that supply meets demand. Countries like Denmark get over 40% of their electricity from wind, and they’ve built systems capable of balancing renewable output in real-time.
                            
                            <br> Economic and Environmental Benefits
