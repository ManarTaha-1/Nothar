                                The Crucial Building Blocks of Life on Earth Form More Easily in Outer Space</div>

                        <p><span class="letter">F</span>or many years, scientists believed that the building blocks of life — like amino acids, sugars, and alcohols — mainly formed on Earth. But recent discoveries have shown that these important organic molecules may actually form more easily in outer space, especially in cold and dark regions of space where stars and planets are born.
                            
                            In these areas, dust and gas float around and stick together. When exposed to cosmic rays and ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the atoms and molecules on the surface of these dust grains begin to react. Over time, these reactions create complex organic compounds, including the basic ingredients needed for life. This means that the materials needed to build life — proteins, DNA, and energy systems — could already exist before a planet like Earth is even formed.
                            
                            Scientists have even found amino acids and other organic materials on meteorites that landed on Earth. These space rocks may have carried the first life-related molecules to our planet billions of years ago. One famous example is the Murchison meteorite in Australia, which contained over 70 different amino acids, many of which are used by living things on Earth.
                            
                            This exciting research suggests that life’s ingredients are universal, and not just unique to Earth. If these molecules can form naturally in space, then they might also reach other planets in the same way — meaning life could exist elsewhere in the universe. Some scientists believe that young planets, including Earth, were “seeded” with these molecules during heavy meteorite impacts in the early stages of their formation.
                            
                            So, while Earth may be the only place we know where life exists, the universe may be full of the materials needed for life. Outer space, once thought of as cold and lifeless, might actually be where life begins — quietly, on tiny dust grains floating between the stars.</p>

                        <p><span  class="letter">F</span>or centuries, humanity has gazed up at the stars, wondering if we are alone in the universe. The search for extraterrestrial life has captivated scientists and space enthusiasts alike, driving missions to planets, moons, and beyond. While definitive evidence has yet to be found, advancements in technology and science have brought us closer to answering this age-old question.
                            
                            <br> Advancements in Search Methods
                            The discovery of exoplanets—planets orbiting stars outside our solar system—has been a game-changer in the search for life. Scientists have identified thousands of these planets, many of which are located in the "habitable zone" where liquid water could exist, a key ingredient for life as we know it. Telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are expected to provide more insights into the atmospheres of these exoplanets, searching for signs of biological activity.
                            
                            <br> Missions to Mars and Moons of Jupiter
                            Mars has long been a focus for astrobiologists. Evidence of past water, ancient riverbeds, and even potential subsurface lakes have sparked hopes that microbial life once thrived there. The upcoming NASA missions to Mars, such as the Perseverance rover, aim to explore these possibilities further. Similarly, moons like Europa and Enceladus—found orbiting Jupiter and Saturn—are intriguing targets due to the subsurface oceans beneath their icy crusts. Scientists believe these environments might harbor microbial life.
                            
                            <br> SETI and Radio Signals
                            The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project uses powerful radio telescopes to listen for signals from distant civilizations. While no definitive signals have been detected yet, the sheer size of the universe means that the search is ongoing. Advances in AI and machine learning are being utilized to sift through enormous amounts of data, increasing the chances of finding a signal from intelligent extraterrestrial life.
                            
                            <br> The Fermi Paradox
                            One of the great mysteries of space exploration is the Fermi Paradox—why, given the vast number of habitable planets in the universe, we haven't encountered any signs of extraterrestrial life. Various theories have been proposed, from the possibility that advanced civilizations are avoiding contact to the idea that they may be using technology beyond our comprehension.
