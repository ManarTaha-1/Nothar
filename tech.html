                        <p><span class="letter">I</span>magine typing a message, controlling a robotic arm, or even playing a video game ‚Äî just by thinking. Thanks to Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), this is no longer the stuff of science fiction. These revolutionary systems enable direct communication between the brain and external devices, opening up new frontiers in medicine, communication, and even human potential.
                            
                            <br> 1. What is a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)? 
                            A Brain-Computer Interface is a system that translates brain signals into commands for external devices. BCIs bypass the traditional neuromuscular pathways ‚Äî meaning they can help people who are paralyzed, locked-in, or unable to speak interact with the world in new ways.
                            
                            BCIs work by:
                            
                            Detecting brain activity (typically via EEG or implanted sensors)
                            
                            Interpreting signals using software and algorithms
                            
                            Converting those signals into commands for devices (like a cursor or wheelchair)
                            
                            <br> 2. How BCIs Work 
                            There are several steps involved in a BCI system:
                            
                            Signal Acquisition: Brain activity is recorded using sensors.
                            
                            Non-invasive: EEG caps placed on the scalp.
                            
                            Invasive: Electrodes implanted directly into the brain (for more precision).
                            
                             Signal Processing: The raw brain signals are filtered, analyzed, and translated into meaningful commands.
                            
                             Output Execution: The decoded signals are used to move a cursor, speak words through a synthetic voice, or control a robotic device.
                            
                            <br> 3. Applications of BCIs
